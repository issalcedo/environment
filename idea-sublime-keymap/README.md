idea-sublime-keymap
===================

Dirty version of Sublime keymap for Jetbrains IDEA (PHPStorm, RubyMine, PyCharm, ...)

### Install
#### Windows
  Copy Sublime.xml to config directory.
#### Mac
  Copy Sublime-mac.xml to config directory.

#### Windows and *NIX

`<User home>/.IntelliJ IDEA <xx>/config/keymaps/`

#### Mac OS X
2018 Community Edition: `~/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC2018.1/keymaps/`

Older versions may differ, e.g.: `~/Library/Preferences/.IntelliJ IDEA <xx>/keymaps/`, in newer versions maybe you will have to create the `keymaps` folder

To actually change the keymap open settings (ctrl-alt-s), select the keymap tab and choose "Sublime" in the dropdown menu. You will need to restart the IDE for it to show up.
